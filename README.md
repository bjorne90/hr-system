# HR Mangament ðŸ‘«

HR Mangament is a web solution to facilitate the management of schedules and booking of personnel for work shifts. The system is developed so that users get their own profiles, can check their workshifts, cancel workshifts, update their profile picture and edit their profile. Admin can easily add new shifts, users and news.
